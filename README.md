> **ResQNet** is an offline-first, peer-to-peer mesh communication app built for disaster and emergency scenarios where internet connectivity is unavailable. It uses Bluetooth and WiFi Direct (via Google's Nearby Connections API) to form a decentralized mesh network between nearby Android devices — no internet, no towers, no infrastructure needed.

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

Before setting up, make sure you have the following installed:

### On Your PC

| Tool | Version | Download |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Flutter SDK | >= 3.0.0 | [flutter.dev](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) |
| Dart SDK | Included with Flutter | — |
| Android Studio | Latest | [developer.android.com](https://developer.android.com/studio) |
| Android SDK | API Level 21+ | Via Android Studio |
| Git | Any | [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) |
| Java JDK | 17+ | [adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net/) |

### On Your Android Device

- Android **6.0 (API 23) or higher**
- Bluetooth & Location enabled
- WiFi enabled (for WiFi Direct)
- USB Debugging enabled (for development installs)

---

## 💻 Setup on PC (Development)

### Step 1 — Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Achyuthvenkat/ResQNet.git
cd ResQNet/flutter_app
```

### Step 2 — Install Flutter Dependencies

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Step 3 — Verify Flutter Setup

```bash
flutter doctor
```
Make sure the Android toolchain shows no critical errors. Accept Android licenses if prompted:
```bash
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

### Step 4 — Connect Your Android Device

1. Enable **Developer Options** on your phone:  
   Go to `Settings → About Phone → tap "Build Number" 7 times`
2. Enable **USB Debugging** in Developer Options
3. Connect your phone via USB
4. Verify it's detected:
   ```bash
   flutter devices
   ```
   Your device should appear in the list.

### Step 5 — Run the App

```bash
flutter run
```

To run on a specific device if multiple are connected:
```bash
flutter run -d <device-id>
```

> ⚡ The first build may take **2–5 minutes** as Gradle downloads dependencies. Subsequent builds are much faster.

---

## 📱 Install on Android Device

### Option A — Install via APK (No PC Required)

> *(APK release coming soon — will be available in the [Releases](https://github.com/Achyuthvenkat/ResQNet/releases) section)*

1. Download the latest `resqnet.apk` from [Releases](https://github.com/Achyuthvenkat/ResQNet/releases)
2. On your Android device, go to `Settings → Security → Enable "Install from Unknown Sources"`
3. Open the downloaded APK and tap **Install**
4. Grant all required permissions when prompted

### Option B — Build APK from Source

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Achyuthvenkat/ResQNet.git
cd ResQNet/flutter_app

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Build the APK
flutter build apk --release

# The APK will be located at:
# build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

Transfer `app-release.apk` to your phone and install it.

### Option C — Run Directly via USB (Development)

Follow the [Setup on PC](#-setup-on-pc-development) guide above and use `flutter run`.

> All permissions are requested at runtime when you first launch the app.

---

## 📦 Dependencies

## 🚧 Known Issues

- **OneDrive interference**: If your project folder is inside OneDrive, build files can get corrupted. Move the project to a local path like `C:\dev\ResQNet` to avoid issues.
- **First build slow**: Gradle dependencies take time on the first build — this is normal.
- **Android cmdline-tools**: If `flutter doctor` reports missing `cmdline-tools`, install it via Android Studio → SDK Manager → SDK Tools → Android SDK Command-line Tools.
- **Multi-hop messaging**: Currently in development — messages only travel one hop between directly connected peers.
